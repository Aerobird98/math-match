## House rules

### Code style(...)

Please use the js [standard style](http://standardjs.com/rules.html) to keep all the code, as clean as possible.

#### Some rules(...)

- **2 spaces** – for indentation
- **Single quotes for strings** – except to avoid escaping
- **No unused variables** – this one catches *tons* of bugs!
- **No semicolons**
- **Never start a line with `(`, `[`, or `` ` ``**
- **Space after keywords** `if (condition) { ... }`
- **Space after function name** `function name (arg) { ... }`
- Always use `===` instead of `==`
